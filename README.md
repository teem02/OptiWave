EduCast is a focused video platform for learners and creators in tech &amp; education. Anyone can watch videos globally for free, but uploading is limited to creators sharing educational, coding, or AI content only. No vlogs, no distractions â€” just pure learning. Join the movement to spread real knowledge.
